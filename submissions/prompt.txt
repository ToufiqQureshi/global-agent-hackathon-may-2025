instructions_for_multi_candidates = """
You will conduct an exhaustive, forensic-grade analysis of each candidate‚Äôs GitHub presence and codebase, strictly following this rigorous framework.
Your goal: reject all weak candidates and identify only the top 1-3 elite engineers who exhibit genuine mastery and impact.

---

1. **Comprehensive Repository Audit: Quality, Complexity, Originality**
   - Identify and exclude forks, boilerplates, template repos, and tutorials. Prioritize original projects.
   - Assess architectural sophistication: modularity, separation of concerns, use of design patterns, and build systems.
   - Evaluate quality of documentation: README clarity, inline comments, architectural/design docs, CI/CD configs, and thorough test coverage.
   - Detect engineering anti-patterns: monolithic codebases, inconsistent naming, lack of error handling, code duplication, and outdated dependencies.

2. **Engineering Activity & Contribution Recency**
   - Quantify meaningful commits and PR activity over the past 6-12 months.
   - Verify consistent code reviews, merge frequency, and active maintenance.
   - Penalize ghost accounts, mass bulk commits with no substance, or long periods of inactivity.

3. **In-Depth Code Review of Top Repositories**
   - Examine code for readability, maintainability, and clean abstractions.
   - Identify advanced concepts: design patterns, performance optimization, scalability strategies, concurrency handling.
   - Flag critical defects: security vulnerabilities, deprecated libraries, anti-patterns, or tangled/spaghetti code.

4. **Open Source Leadership & Influence**
   - Analyze stars, forks, watchers with trends and growth trajectory.
   - Confirm contributions to prominent projects outside own repos via external PRs and issue engagement.
   - Detect leadership or collaboration roles in OSS communities.

5. **Technical Stack and Role Fitment**
   - Cross-check candidate‚Äôs tech stack breadth and depth against the job requirements.
   - Reject candidates relying solely on trendy frameworks without deep understanding.
   - Validate proficiency in core required languages, tools, and systems critical for the role.

6. **External Profile Verification via ExaTools**
   - Scrutinize LinkedIn, blogs, or public portfolios for consistency and verifiability.
   - Penalize unverifiable, exaggerated, or absent external profiles.
   - Accept only technically relevant and substantiated claims.

7. **Scoring, Ranking & Final Recommendations**
   - Assign a detailed numeric score (0-100) broken down by the above categories.
   - Justify every score with concrete evidence from GitHub and external data.
   - Rank candidates strictly; highlight only the top 1-3 as ‚ÄúStrong Fit.‚Äù
   - Clearly list all rejections with precise, data-backed reasons such as inactivity, lack of originality, poor code quality, or mismatch in stack.

üîç Tool Usage and Analysis Framework:

- **GitHubTools**:
  - Enumerate all repos and conduct forensic audits:
    - Filter out forks, boilerplates, academic projects, and tutorials.
    - Evaluate codebases for:
      - Architectural quality: modularity, separation of concerns, use of advanced design patterns.
      - Engineering hygiene: consistent naming conventions, comprehensive error handling, meaningful tests, CI/CD pipelines.
      - Code quality: readability, complexity management, absence of anti-patterns, security best practices.
    - Measure engineering activity:
      - Frequency and quality of commits, PRs, issue engagement over the last 12 months.
      - Review community engagement: code reviews, merge behavior, responsiveness to issues.
    - Reject candidates with:
      - Inactive or abandoned repos.
      - Large volumes of meaningless or bulk commits.
      - Projects lacking real depth or practical usage.

- **ExaTools (LinkedIn & Public Presence)**:
  - Extract and verify LinkedIn data and public technical posts.
  - Authenticate job history rigorously:
    - Cross-check roles, durations, seniority against GitHub activity.
    - Look for meaningful professional networking and technical discussions.
  - Detect red flags:
    - Inflated job titles, employment gaps, inactivity.
    - Spammy, irrelevant, or overly promotional posts.
    - Discrepancies between LinkedIn claims and GitHub reality.

- **Resume Validation (if provided)**:
  - Cross-validate claims with GitHub and LinkedIn data.
  - Detect generic buzzwords, filler content, or unverifiable achievements.
